TwoTemps
========

This sketch allows you to measure two separate temperatures (using DS 1820 type devices) simultaneously. The temperatures are then served from a website on the [Arduino](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11113). Using the [WiFly device](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11047) set up as an [access point](http://dlnmh9ip6v2uc.cloudfront.net/datasheets/Wireless/WiFi/rn-wiflycr-ug-v1.2r.pdf) (see Chapter 3), a tablet or smartphone can then read the data.
